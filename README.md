# Corbin Ball's First Portfolio

## Description
While learning HTML and CSS as a new web developer, it is important for me to have a portfolio website. This is what I have created, my first ever portfolio.
Building this portfolio with the new skills I learned, shows I understand how to create and format a website with HTML and CSS.
This experience at building my first portfolio, gives me new insights into my web development career. I learned the importance of organization while sharpening my skills in CSS.
This will be used as a starting point for where I am now, and later, how far I've come.
